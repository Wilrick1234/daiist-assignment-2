Every assumption the pipeline and the dashboard depend on, in one place.
 
train.py and app.py both import this file. The app recomputes all costs from
the saved test-set scores every time it starts, so after changing a cost figure
you only need to restart the app. Re-run training only if you change the
dataset or training settings.
 
BUSINESS CASE (fictional): Chispa Componentes S.L., a Tier-1 automotive
supplier in Getafe, robot-welds steel rear subframes for a European carmaker's
SUV. A subframe holds the rear suspension, so a failed weld is a safety issue.
Today inspectors check every critical seam by hand; the plant wants a camera +
model system that passes, fails, or routes each weld photo to a human.
The reasoning behind every figure below is written up in REPORT.md.
